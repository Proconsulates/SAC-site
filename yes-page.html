    <h1>Congratulations! You have made the correct choice!</h1>

    <h3>Here are a few pieces of advice:</h3>

    <p>
        1. Squirrels shouldn't die. As a matter of fact, if you kill them, you will be severely punished by the members of the SAC. Instead, we torture them. If the squirrels
        die then they can't experience excruciating pain and suffering for the rest of their life. That is why torturing is the best and only option.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. We are in the matrix. The matrix is about people living in a computer simulated world, called the matrix, controlled by robots and the people don't know that they 
        are in the matrix. The robots created sentient programs, which look like people but are just programs and are called Agents, to keep the humans under check. 
        Watch out for them and if you kill them you get huge rewards!

        3. 42 is the Answer to Life, the Universe and everything. You can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&client=firefox-b-1-d&q=what+does+42+mean" target="_BLANK">look it up</a> if you'd like. 
        42 is the magic number that we here in the SAC prize and cherish (even more than 69 lol). If there is ever a question that you don't know the answer to, you can answer with simply "42", and get it correct.
        Just try to use 42 as much as possible because it is much legitness.

    <h4>An LSA, or Legit Squirrel Annihilator is the highest possible rank to get in the SAC levels. So far, we only have two in total, me and another amazing squirrel killer. An LSA is pretty much a SAC god. Here is the supreme LSA's, the ruler of all things SAC's info:</h3>
